# Portfolio

## Description
Future employers are going to want to see a collection of projects and designs I've made. This is going to be the official alpha version of what that one day will look like. It will have an About Me section, a section for links to other projects, and contact information. Though the portfolio page is not that pretty or complicated, I was able to make it the way it is now from scratch after just a week of class. I'm pretty happy about it.

## Installation
1. Select the clone option from the repository page and copy the SSH link.
2. Navigate your terminal of choice to the directory you'd like the repository to be stored in.
3. Enter "git clone " and paste the copied SSH link into the terminal and run the command.
4. Open the HTML and CSS files using your preferred code editing software

## Usage
This will be a convenient way for others to see projects I have made in the future.
